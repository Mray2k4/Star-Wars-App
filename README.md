## Summary
This project I learned about API's and getting information from them. It was a challenging but fun project to do. My biggest hurdle was sharing data between components. I could get information to show up on the console.log but rendering it on screen I had trouble with it. I still need to understand useEffect and props a bit more but overall I got the concept of them. I learned a lot throughout this project and still learning more about React.
